        <h1>Final Project: Natural Disasters in The US</h1>
        <h2>April 28, 2025</h2>
        <h2>Alan Fisher Branltey</h2>

        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>It should be known that the United States is common for many typesof  natural disasters to 
            occur. This is something to consider when it comes to becomming a future resident or even 
            looking for a places to travel. These visuals should provide an over view to show what 
            natural where natural disasters are likely to occur in the United States.
        </p>

        <p>The information was pulled from <a href=
            https://www.fema.gov/openfema-data-page/disaster-declarations-summaries-v2>fema.gov</a>. The
            data is from 1953 to present with information about natural disasters in the United
            States. 
        </p>

        <h3>Disasters by Year and State</h3>
        <p>The visual shown below is a interactive visual that can take in a year(s) filter input,
            selected state(s) filter input or a selected natual disaster filter input. The visuals will 
            change depending on the filters applied, altering the colors or size of the graphs. If no 
            filter is applied to the graphs, they are going to show all years, states and natural disasters
            that have taken place. If you wish to select more than one item in either the graph or map be
            sure to CTRL + LClick each item and for different years just select each one on the top right.
        </p>

        <p>
            These graphs are intended to show where most natural disasters have occured in each state,
            as well as the disasters caused in certain states and the disasters that occur within certain 
            years.
        </p>

        <p>
            It may be pretty easy that to notice on the graphs that California and Texas are really 
            saturated with red. This is due to the amount of wild fires that have had occured for over the 
            years in these two states. These environments are prone to being dry so it has some sense of 
            being this way. This is further supported if we select the 'Fire', with no other filters active, 
            column in the graph to show that places in the west are common for these natural disasters. 
        </p>
        
        <p>
            If we wish to look at some of the more recent (past 5) years, we can see that California has 
            the most natural disasters in the US. Most of the natural disasters that have occured in the 
            US appears to be Fires with 307 incidents and most of which are shown to occur in California.
        </p>

        <p>    
            Lastly, we can select a state such as South Carolina, with no other filters active, to show that
            hurricanes occur the most in this state with a number of 16 incidents. If we continue to select 
            a few more states in the East Coast such as Georgia, North Carolina, and Virginia, the natural 
            disasters begin to shift in the graph showing severe storms becoming the highest occured with 
            a count of 49 and 42 incidents of hurricanes being second highest.
        </p>

        <p>
            The point of these graphs are to show specific trends between areas and their climates such fires
            being more common in the West Coast, hurricanes in eastern US, and the Mid-West often experiencing
            severe storms. Playing around with the values shall show certain trends with natural disasters in
            the United States.
        </p>

        <h3>Disasters by Year and State</h3>
        <p>This heat map shows the average unique incident per year of each state dating back to 1953. 
            This map is gives you more of a summarized view of each states history. With each year, some
            states seem to have more disasters occur than the others despite some of them getting more 
            disasters on average. Using this map, it can be easier to determine which state is safer from
            natural disasters on average.

            If we take a look at the map, we can in fact see that certain states like California and Texas 
            still have a higher average of disasters that occur but something that be unexpected is the 
            fact that Oklahoma has the overall highest average which is not completely apparent in the 
            first map above. This shows that these states average disasters more often and potentially 
            contain more dangerous climates.

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>These visuals are able to provide us with information about natural disasters in the US. With the 
            help of the heat map and graph, we can see that hurricanes mostly common in the East Coast,
            the West having the most incidents with fires and the Mid-West prone to Severe Storms. The states
            that appear to have the most occured incidents from 1953 to present are California and Texas.
            Information about the most recent years, ranging from 2020-2025, has shown that fires are the
            occured with 307 incidents and California having the most incidents of this natural disaster.
        </p>
            
        <p>
            If we look back at the second heat map, we can see that Oklahoma has averaged the highest amount
            of incidents per year. Following in close second would be Texas and then California. This informs
            us that these states are more common to have incidents of natural disasters to occur making them
            more potentially hazardous.
